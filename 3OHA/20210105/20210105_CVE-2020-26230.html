<h1>CVE-2020-26230</h1>

<p>
In September 2020, we identified a vulnerability in
<a href="https://github.com/radarcovid/">Radar COVID</a>, the official
COVID-19 exposure notification app for Spain. The vulnerability enables the
identification and de-anonymization of COVID-19 positive users that upload
Temporary Exposure Keys (TEKs) to the server. The root cause is the fact
that connections from the app to the backend server to upload TEKs are
only made by COVID-19 positive users. Therefore, any on-path observer with
the ability to monitor traffic between the app and the server can identify
which users had a positive test.
</p>

<p>
The vector string and CVSS score are:

<br><br>
<b>Vector:</b> CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N<br>
<b>Base Score:</b> 7.4 (HIGH)
</p>

<p>
The issue was fixed by late October 2020 and the vulnerability obtained an
official number in November 13, 2020. More details are available in
the
<a
href="https://github.com/RadarCOVID/radar-covid-backend-dp3t-server/security/advisories/GHSA-w7jx-37x3-w2jx">security
advisory</a> published in the official GitHub repository of the app and the
<a
href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26230">CVE-2020-26230</a>
entry in the NVD.
